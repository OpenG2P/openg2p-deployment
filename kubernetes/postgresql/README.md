## PostgreSQL

- PostgreSQL can now be installed directly as part of the respective OpenG2P Module. For example, refer to [Social Registry deployment](https://docs.openg2p.org/social-registry/deployment) or [PBMS deployment](https://docs.openg2p.org/pbms/deployment).

- If you want to install PostgreSQL seperately on your K8s cluster, it is recommended to use [Bitnami's PostgreSQL helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql).
