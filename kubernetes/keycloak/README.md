## Keycloak

This directory contains instructions to install Keycloak.
This Keycloak is only one per Organization (which is now suggested to be installed as part of [Rancher](../rancher)).

This is NOT to be installed on OpenG2P cluster (except when in box mode).

The client creation and Keycloak init scripts have been removed in favor of the above.
And relevant keycloak related instructions have been added wherever required.

The older scripts & instructions can be found at this [link](https://github.com/OpenG2P/openg2p-deployment/tree/f2dfa3673ce272a552eafff1496faed68f0575ab/kubernetes/keycloak).
