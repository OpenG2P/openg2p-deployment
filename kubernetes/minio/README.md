## Minio

- Minio can now be installed directly as part of the respective OpenG2P Module. For example, refer to [Social Registry deployment](https://docs.openg2p.org/social-registry/deployment) or [PBMS deployment](https://docs.openg2p.org/pbms/deployment).

- If you want to install Minio seperately on your K8s cluster, it is recommended to use [Bitnami's Minio helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/minio)/[Minio Operator](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/operations/installation.html).
